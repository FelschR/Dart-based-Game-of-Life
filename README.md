Dart-based Game of Life
====================

The development of this project has stopped.

This was basically only a small project for me to try out the Dart programming language.
It was originally intended as a multiplayer version of Conway's Game of Life but no multiplayer capabilities were implemented.
The simulation with all basic rules is working.
